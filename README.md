# Hi! I'm Tiffany Mo

I am currently a Sophmore studying Computer Science at Occidental College interested in the intersetion between the tech and entertainment industries. Specifically, I am most interested in Mobile App or Game development as well as Animation and Compiter Graphics. I love studying Computer Science in Los Angeles because it gives me the ability to explore both of these interests!
